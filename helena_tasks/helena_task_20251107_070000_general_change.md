## 📋 **YOUR TASK (Helena)**

This change was **automatically detected** and requires propagation to ALL databases.

### **What You Must Do:**

1. **Analyze the change:**
   - Read the full file: `src/intelligence/services/local_intelligence_service.py`
   - Understand what it does
   - Identify what information needs to be in databases

2. **Update PostgreSQL:**
   - Add to `team_tools` if it's a new tool
   - Add to `agent_capabilities` if it changes agent abilities
   - Add to `project_processes` if it's a new process
   - Create SQL script in `sql/` directory

3. **Update Neo4j:**
   - Create nodes for new tools/processes/agents
   - Create relationships showing connections
   - Create Cypher script in `sql/` directory

4. **Update Qdrant:**
   - Index the documentation semantically
   - Make it searchable by meaning
   - Use script in `scripts/` directory

5. **Update Redis:**
   - Create cache entries for quick access
   - Set appropriate TTL
   - Use docker exec commands

6. **Verify:**
   - Run: `python3 scripts/verify_task_completion.py`
   - All checks must pass
   - Provide evidence

7. **Report:**
   - Create completion report
   - Include verification results
   - Save as: `/Users/artur/coursor-agents-destiny-folder/helena_tasks/completed_20251107_070000.md`

---

## ⚠️ **CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS**

- ✅ You MUST complete this within 4 hours
- ✅ You MUST update ALL 4 databases (PostgreSQL, Neo4j, Qdrant, Redis)
- ✅ You MUST run verification before reporting
- ✅ You MUST provide evidence with completion report
- ✅ If blocked, report IMMEDIATELY to Aleksander

---

## 📊 **VERIFICATION CRITERIA**

Your task is complete ONLY when:

```sql
-- PostgreSQL check
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM team_tools WHERE file_path LIKE '%src/intelligence/services/local_intelligence_service.py%';
-- Should return > 0

-- Neo4j check
MATCH (n) WHERE n.file_path CONTAINS 'src/intelligence/services/local_intelligence_service.py' RETURN count(n);
-- Should return > 0
```

```bash
# Qdrant check
curl -X POST http://localhost:6333/collections/destiny-team-framework-master/points/scroll \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"filter": {"must": [{"key": "file_path", "match": {"text": "src/intelligence/services/local_intelligence_service.py"}}]}}' | jq '.result.points | length'
# Should return > 0

# Redis check
docker exec kg-redis redis-cli KEYS "*local_intelligence_service*"
# Should return > 0
```

## 🎯 **ACCOUNTABILITY**

This task was **AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED** because the system detected a change.

**This proves:**
- ✅ System monitors itself
- ✅ No human needs to remember
- ✅ Zero knowledge drift guaranteed
- ✅ Continuous monitoring works

**Helena, you are accountable for:**
1. Executing this task completely
2. Updating all databases
3. Running verification
4. Reporting with evidence

**If you don't complete this task:**
- ❌ Knowledge drift occurs
- ❌ Agents won't discover this change
- ❌ Project soundness degrades
- ❌ System breaks down
